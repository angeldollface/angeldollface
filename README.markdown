## About me :books:

Hi! ;) My name is Alexander Abraham and I am a student from Vienna, Austria. I study English Literature at the University of Vienna, I code, I write short stories, and I make some kick-ass art. I've been coding for ten years and I've taught myself a whole lotta languages and frameworks in that time. Among these are:

- Python: My one true love. :heart: I only use Python for small scripts and writing Django websites, really.
- HTML 5: I use this to make skeletons.
- CSS 3: I use this to give my skeletons some flesh and pretty clothes.
- JavaScript: I use this to make skeletons do stuff every now and again.
- Dart: I mainly use this to make apps that I want/need using Flutter.
- Rust: I use this because it is the new kid on the block and might give the other kids a run for their money.
- SASS: I use this for writing CSS more efficiently and in a more structured way.
- Vue.js 3: I use this make small, funky, and interesting little projects that have some practical use.
- React.js: I use this because it is the gold standard apparently.
- Three.js: I use this to make interesting stuff happen in the browser, mainly in 3D form.
