# About me :books:

Hi! :wave: My name is Alexander Abraham and I live in Vienna, Austria. I have a BA in English and American Studies from the University of Vienna, I code, write short stories, and I am always curious. I've been writing code for quite some time and I have taught myself many frameworks, libraries, and languages. If you would like to find out more about my skills, you can view a full list of these [here](https://angeldollface.art/content/skills). The languages I am currently learning more about are C and C#.

Copyright Notice: All art on my profile and in my projects is my own and was made by me.

Nota bene: If you want to run my NPX greeting card, make sure you have Node.js installed and available from the command line!
To run my greeting card, simply run the command below:

```bash
npx angeldollface
```

Sincerely,

\- ***Angel Dollface*** :dolls: :ribbon:
