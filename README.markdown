## About me :books:

Hi! :wave: My name is Alexander Abraham and I am a student from Vienna, Austria. I have a bachelor in English and American Studies from the University of Vienna, I code, I write short stories, and I'm interested in many things. I've been writing code for quite some time and I have taught myself many frameworks, libraries, and languages. If you would like to find out more about my skills, visit [this link](https://angeldollface.art).

Nota bene: If you want to run my NPX greeting card, make sure you have Node.js installed and available from the command line!
To run my greeting card, simply run the command below:

```bash
npx angeldollface
```

Sincerely,

\- ***Angel Dollface*** :dolls: :ribbon:
