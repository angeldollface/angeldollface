# About me :books:

Hi! :wave: My name is Alexander Abraham and I live in Vienna, Austria. I have a BA in English and American Studies from the University of Vienna and one of my main passions is writing some code. I've been doing this for some time and taught myself a few interesting things. :wink: If you want to get an overview of what I've done over time, feel free to peruse my GitHub profile at your leisure. If not stated otherwise, the projects on my profile are my own, from conception to implementation.
Any non-code assets on my profile and in my projects are my own and were made by me and are not to be used without my approval.

Sincerely,

\- ***Angel Dollface*** :dolls: :ribbon:
